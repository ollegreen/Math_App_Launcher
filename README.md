# Solve a multiplication problem to launch your app

Basically a script to practice some multiplication if your a bit rusty on your math like me. 

I found it to be more efficient when you implement it in an app which you open regularly. For me it is Chrome, so everytime I wanna open it I launch this script and solve the math problem to be able to laucnh chrome. 

Cheers.
